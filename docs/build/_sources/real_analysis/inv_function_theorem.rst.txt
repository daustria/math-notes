The Inverse Function Theorem
==============================


.. admonition:: Theorem

	Let :math:`F : W \to \mathbb{R}^n` be a :math:`C^r` mapping, :math:`r = 1,2, \ldots` or :math:`\infty`. Suppose
	:math:`a \in W` with :math:`DF(a)` a non-singular matrix. Then there is a neighbourhood :math:`U` of `W` 
	containing :math:`a` such that :math:`V = F(U)` is open and :math:`F|_U : U \to V` is a diffeomorphism.

	Moreover, we have the following formula for the differential of :math:`F^{-1}`

	.. math::
		DF^{-1}(y) = (DF(x))^{-1} \quad x \in U, y = F(x).


Still in progress.
